                <h3>Ransomware: To Pay or Not To Pay</h3>


                <p>

                Ransomware has become the new-age way of bullying. In relation to school, a bully forces you to give them what they want, or threaten to cause you harm if you dont comply. Same principle with ransomware, except the harm inflicted isn't physical in nature, it's financial and emotional pain given it hurts your financial accounts and reputation. The principles to defending yourself are similar also, standing up to the bully may force them to back off when they notice youre not an easy mark, but it can also be risky!<br> There are also other variables that may determine which route a company takes if they're breached. Did they have adequate backups in place? Was any serious customer PII breached such as debit card numbers and ssn, and was such info heavily encrypted or no? Companies that didn't have the proper safeguards in place may have no other choice, which is why implementing the proper security practices can make or break an organization.
